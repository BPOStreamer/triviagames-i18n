## How can I contribute?
Create a pull request with your changes, language files are named `[two-letter code].json`, you can find a list of two letter language codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).  
For example `en.json` for English, `ru.json` for Russian, `uk.json` for Ukrainian and so on.
The `en.json` will always be updated with the latest text to translate, so use that as a base and just translate what you can of your language!
